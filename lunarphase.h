/**
  Represents and manages a Lunar Phase

  A Lunar Phase can be one of the following:

   + "new": the moon is not visible; or traditionally: first visible
            crescent of the Moon.  For religious purposes, the new
            month begins when the first crescent moon can be seen.
            Thus, it is impossible to be certain in advance of when
            months will begin; in particular, the exact date on which
            Ramadan will begin is not known in advance. In Saudi Arabia,
            observers are sent up in airplanes if the weather is cloudy
            when the new moon is expected.
   + "first quarter": the right 50% of the moon is visible.
   + "full": the moon is fully visible.
   + "last quarter": the left 50% of the moon is visible.

   A very good description of the lunar phases can be read at the Wikipedia,
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase

   Note that crescent and gibbous phases are not currently supported.
