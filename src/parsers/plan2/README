To generate the Bison/Flex parser/scanner code after any changes to
holidayparserplan.ypp or holidayscannerplan.lpp run:

    bison -d -o holidayparserplan.cpp holidayparserplan.ypp
    flex -i -B -oholidayscannerplan.cpp holidayscannerplan.lpp

Do not add this to the build system as it may be broken by differences in the
installed versions of Bison and Flex on the build system.

The following files will be generated:

    holidayparserplan.hpp
    holidayparserplan.cpp
    holidayscannerplan.hpp
    holidayscannerplan.cpp
    stack.hh
    location.hh
    position.hh

This version was built using Bison v2.3 and Flex v2.5.35.  No later versions
are guaranteed to work.  In particular, it uses v2.1a of the Bison C++
skeleton (lalr1.cc), this skeleton was changed and renamed in Bison v2.4.
