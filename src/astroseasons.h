/**
  Represents and manages the Astronomical Seasons (solstices and equinoxes).
  For the purposes of this class, we sometimes use the shorthand of "Season"
  where we really mean "Astronomical Season".

  An Astronomical Season can be one of the following:

   - June solstice
   - December solstice
   - March equinox
   - September equinox

   A very good description of the astronomical seasons can be read at the
   Wikipedia,
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasons

   Note that this class represents the "Astronomical Seasons" and not
   the traditional "Seasons" which vary widely by culture.
