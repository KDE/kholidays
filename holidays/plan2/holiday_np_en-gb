Dates for 2026–2030 are provided where reliable conversions were available (Dashain series 2025–2030, and selected projected dates). Many lunar festivals (Holi, Teej, Janai Purnima, Buddha Jayanti, Ghode Jatra, Maha Shivaratri, Ram Navami, Krishna Janmashtami, Eid dates) vary year-to-year by lunar observation and official announcement; confirm with the official Nepali government gazette or a local authoritative calendar for final, legal dates.
