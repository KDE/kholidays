:: Notes:
::
:: 1) The day off on some public holidays is moved to the Monday of the holiday week. That's why there are some dates that are repeated with the word "Descanso" (day off) at the beginning.
:: 2) Though some dates aren't a day off for public nor private sectors, they're for schools. All the school day off have the "school" category.
:: 3) Some holidays aren't days off, but they're remembered and even a ceremony is held on those days. All these kind of dates have the "civil" category.
:: 4) The states bordering the U.S. change to daylight saving time on a different date than the rest of the country.
